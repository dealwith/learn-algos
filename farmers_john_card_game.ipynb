    "# Farmer John's Card Game\n",
    "\n",
    "## Constraints\n",
    "- **Time limit per test:** 2 seconds  \n",
    "- **Memory limit per test:** 256 megabytes\n",
    "\n",
    "link - https://codeforces.com/group/Y4DNzgBYCr/contest/585569/problem/F?locale=en\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Farmer John's **𝑛** cows are playing a card game! Farmer John has a deck of **𝑛⋅𝑚** cards numbered from **0** to **𝑛⋅𝑚−1**. He distributes **𝑚** cards to each of his **𝑛** cows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Farmer John wants the game to be **fair**, so each cow should only be able to play **one** card per round. He decides to determine a turn order, represented by a **permutation** **𝑝** of length **𝑛**, such that the **𝑝ᵢ**'th cow will be the **𝑖**'th cow to place a card on top of the center pile in a round.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Game Rules\n",
    "In each round, the following events occur in order:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The **𝑝₁**'th cow places **any** card from their deck on top of the center pile.\n",
    "2. The **𝑝₂**'th cow places **any** card from their deck on top of the center pile.\n",
    "3. ...\n",
    "4. The **𝑝ₙ**'th cow places **any** card from their deck on top of the center pile.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Constraints\n",
    "- Initially, the **center pile** contains a card numbered **−1**.\n",
    "- A cow can place a card **only if** its number is **greater than** the top card of the center pile.\n",
    "- The newly placed card becomes the **top card** of the center pile.\n",
    "- If a cow **cannot** place any card from its deck during a round, the **game is lost**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "Farmer John wonders: **Does there exist a permutation** 𝑝 such that all cows can empty their decks after playing **all** 𝑚 rounds?  \n",
    "\n",
    "- If **yes**, output **any valid permutation** 𝑝.\n",
    "- If **no**, output **−1**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Input Format\n",
    "\n",
    "- The first line contains an integer **𝑡** (**1 ≤ 𝑡 ≤ 400**) — the number of test cases.\n",
    "- The first line of each test case contains two integers **𝑛** and **𝑚** (**1 ≤ 𝑛⋅𝑚 ≤ 2000**) — the number of cows and the number of cards each cow receives.\n",
    "- The next **𝑛** lines contain **𝑚** integers each — the cards received by each cow.\n",
    "- It is guaranteed that all given numbers (across all **𝑛** lines) are **distinct** and in the range **0** to **𝑛⋅𝑚−1**, inclusive.\n",
    "- It is guaranteed that the sum of **𝑛⋅𝑚** over all test cases **does not exceed 2000**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Output Format\n",
    "\n",
    "For each test case, output the following on a new line:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If a valid permutation **𝑝** exists, output **𝑛** space-separated integers **𝑝₁, 𝑝₂, …, 𝑝ₙ**.\n",
    "- Otherwise, output **−1**.\n",

    "## Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **permutation of length 𝑛** contains **each integer from 1 to 𝑛 exactly once**.\n",
    "- The order of cows determines who plays first, second, etc., **in every round**.\n",
    "- You may return **any valid permutation** that allows the game to be successfully played.\n"
